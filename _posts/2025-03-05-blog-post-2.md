# Attackers Think Ahead - Do You? The Power of Threat Modelling

- Written by Elia Nikolaou

Confidence is great, until you realize you’ve walked straight into a trap. In *The Lion King*, young Simba's overconfidence leads him straight into an ambush, one he never saw coming. Funny enough, this is exactly what happens in our world. When speaking about cyber-security we often see organizations fall into a similar trap, assuming their defenses are strong enough, only to be caught off guard by unforeseen vulnerabilities. 

The biggest threats are often the ones we don’t anticipate. Threat modeling is about thinking ahead, identifying weak spots before attackers do, and ensuring confidence is backed by preparation, not just bravado. 

***Scenario:***

Imagine that we live in a perfect world, where everything works just as it should. People follow their daily routines ☕, no one is suspicious of anyone else 🕵️‍♂️, and life moves along in peaceful harmony. Sounds amazing, right? 🌈✨

And in this world, we have a bank 🏦, a reliable fortress where people stash their hard-earned money 💰, knowing it will be safe for years to come. Maybe even long enough to fund their child’s dream of a PhD in Cybersecurity 🎓. After all, the bank surely has *some* security measures in place… right? 🤨🔐

And now, meet Rob. Rob is a smart guy (**a really smart guy)**. He’s got a wealth of expertise in systems, an impressive knowledge of how things work, and a mind sharper than most. 💡

But there’s just one small problem… something inside him doesn’t quite *align* with the world around him. Instead of using his skills for good, he starts thinking: *"With everything I know, why should I play by the rules? What if I could make a little extra money and enjoy this so-called perfect world… just a little bit more?"* 💭

And so, Rob starts plotting. Because after all, who would ever suspect such a smart, talented guy? 

And the plan? Oh, it’s simple. All he needs to do is find a way to crack the bank’s safe 🏦🔓 and walk away with the money people had been saving—ironically, to make their kids smarter than Rob. And if one of his options works, then he can be rich and enjoy life.💸

## **But Wait… Did Rob’s Plan Work? For Real?**

Did he crack the system, outsmart the security, and walk away a rich man? 💰💻 Or did he run into something he hadn’t planned for? 

The real question is: did the bank anticipate someone like Rob? Did they map out potential threats, identify vulnerabilities, and put the right security controls in place?

See, Rob is smart. But **smart defenders think ahead**. If the bank had done their job right, they would have asked the **right questions before the attack even happened**:

- *What are the most valuable assets we need to protect?*
- *Who might try to break in (like, say… a Rob)?*
- *What weaknesses could they exploit?*
- *How can we make it so that in case of attack, we will keep our assets secure?*

## This is exactly the idea behind what we call: Threat Modelling.

A proactive way to **think like an attacker, identify security gaps, and strengthen defenses before an attack happens**. 🛡️ Instead of waiting for someone like Rob to expose their weaknesses, smart organizations **map out threats in advance** and build their defenses accordingly.

So, did Rob succeed? If the bank used **threat modelling**, the answer is possible to be as simple as **No.**

### Because in cybersecurity, the best way to stop an attack… is to see it coming. 🚀
