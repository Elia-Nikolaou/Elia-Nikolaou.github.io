During my internship at [drand](https://drand.love), I had the opportunity to dive deep into the fascinating world of cryptographic protocols. My MSc final project focused on Distributed Key Generation (DKG) algorithms, a crucial component in decentralized security systems. To share my learnings, I authored a blog post exploring the intricacies of these algorithms.

In this article, I take you on a journey through Treasure Hunting Together: An Exploration of the Beauty of Distributed Key Generation Algorithms. From understanding the fundamentals of cryptographic randomness to exploring the collaborative nature of key generation, this blog aims to demystify one of the most elegant mechanisms in modern cryptography.
