⚡ A fun fact about me: If you translate my name from Greek to English, it simply means **"Olive"**🫒.

I am a **first-year PhD candidate** at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), pursuing research in [Cyber Security, Privacy and Trust](https://cyber.ed.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [David Aspinall](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/). Before that, I completed my MSc in Information Security at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)  completed my final project under the supervision of [Philipp Jovanovic](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/75518-philipp-jovanovic).

My research interests lie in **Formal Methods for Security, Privacy, and Safety**, as well as the theoretical foundations of security, semantic methods and malware analysis. Additionally, I have a keen interest in **Human-Computer Interaction** and its role in enhancing security and privacy in digital systems.

When I am not buried in research, you will find me lost in a good book 📚, out on a hike ⛰️, or wandering through the stars ✨— at least in theory, by reading about constellations and the universe. 🌌🔭 

I am also a proud member of the [Scouts](https://www.scouts.org.uk/) since 2007, where I have had the privilege of attending several international camps around the world 🌍🏕️!
